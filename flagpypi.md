# Flagpypi

```text
Our team has developed a Python package to optimize energy distribution and traffic flow in Intellitown.
We've rigorously tested it and are confident there are no secrets hidden within the code. But in a city this
complex, can you dig deeper and ensure everything is as secure as we believe? The future of the city's
infrastructure is in your hands! python3 import flagpypi Flag
Format:flag{t_th3_fl8g_l00ks_s0meth1ng_w1th_le11ers_an3_ch8r8cters}
```

## Notes

Created a python virtual environment with `python3 -m venv ./.venv` and installed the package with `pip install flagpypi`.
